Assigning lambdas


Here is a function:

    (lambda x: x + 1)

The lambda can be omitted, so this works:

    (x: x + 1)

If there are no arguments:

    (lambda: 5 + 6)

or just:

    (5 + 6)

This is handy for examining vars, e.g.

    (USER)

The focus here is on assignment statements. These do the same thing:

    ELEVEN = (lambda: 5 + 6)

    ELEVEN = (: 5 + 6)

    ELEVEN = (5 + 6)

In other words:

- If "lambda " is not present, "lambda: " is assumed.

- The resulting stuff between parens is evaluated as a function.

But this gets clunky if we want to assign a function to a variable. E.g.

    inc = (lambda x: x + 1)

doesn't work. lambda is present, so the stuff between parens is left
alone. Evaluating that, x is unbound so we get an error message.

Fix:

- Let (lambda x: ...) be understood as (lambda: lambda x: ...). I.e.,
  a lambda with one or more args implies that a function is being
  returned.

- If you really want a function of zero args, it would have to be
  (lambda: lambda: ...) But that should be pretty uncommon.


                        Assign   Other context

  (lambda: ...)         eval     eval

  (lambda args: ...)    (1)      eval

  (...)                 eval     eval

  (: ...)               eval     eval

  (args: ...)           (2)      eval


1) Add "lambda: " prefix, then eval

2) Add "lambda: lambda " prefix, then eval
