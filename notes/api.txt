The API is undocumented, need to fix that. Parts

1. Give the API functions real signatures, e.g. 

    gen(count=0, start=0, pad=None)

  instead of 

    gen(*args, **kwargs):

  (Compare gen.py/gen to api.py/gen)

2. docstrings

3. Generate doc package, as osh did with epydoc.

#1 is just a lot of typing.

#2 is more complicated. It would be nice to keep the docstrings
consistent with the command docstrings. Could play games with
assigning api/gen.__doc__, for example, but that won't work with IDEs.

What about this (in api.py):

- Write a tool to MODIFY api.py. It would look for
  marcel.marcel.__init__.public, for example, to find the functions
  needing docstrings.

- The tool would get the marcel/cli module-level docstring, and
  generate the api docstring. Add docstring if it isn't there, replace
  it otherwise.

- Don't update API doc if CLI doc hasn't changed.

Run this tool as first step in packaging so that a release gets
up-to-date API docstrings.

*** Problem: Can't do this as part of packaging. Needs to be a
    separate step so that the changes can be committed to git.

#3: After API docstrings updated, generate doc package.
