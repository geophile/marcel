Error handling choices are general -- should apply to CLI, and all APIs:

- Default: Handle it with out, if out is present. But what is the default
  if there is no terminal out operator? Does printing the error when it occurs
  produce the same ordering? It should.

- Exception (killing command)

- Call function

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Can print an Error when KillAndResume is raised. Don't have Out op
implement receive_error. Still need to carry the Error along the
stream, however, to get relayed from remote execution, and then be
labelled by LabelThread.

Problem with this approach: ls can complain about permission errors,
and then move on with its recursion. ls.visit does
self.send(Error(...)). Raising a KillAndResume ends the
ls. KillAndResume mechanism is OK usually, I think, but not in this
case. So RELYING on raise of KARE doesn't work here. 
Same in bash, reporting stderr.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Redesign:

Fatal error: 

- Invoke handler.
- Pass Error downstream. Has to reach the end in case of remote.
- Raise KARE.

Non-fatal error (e.g. bash, ls):

- Invoke handler.
- Pass Error downstream.

Local execution:

- Default handler does Error.render_full().
- Collect the into a list made available at the end of execution.
- These can all be accomplished by profiding a handler function

Remote execution:

- IGNORE.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Implementation:

Op.fatal_error(inputs, message)

- Invokes handler 
- Raises KARE

Op.non_fatal_error(inputs, message)

- Invokes handler

KARE:

- Modified to carry the Error (not op, inputs, message)

core.receive_input etc.:

- Passes the Error (contained in the KARE) downstream.
