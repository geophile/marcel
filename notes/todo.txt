 Complete Python string parsing

- Complete shell string parsing (termination on things other than EOL
  and whiteapce).

- Debugging & verbosity level

----------------------------------------------------------------------

- Organize internal ops -- Fork, LabelThread

- How do exit codes fit in?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Provide a way to specify farcel config path. Maybe as a property of
the cluster.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Distinct color for broken symlink.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Tab completion:

- Tab completion for command should distinguish between first op of
  pipeline and subsequent ones. I.e., only show those ops that can be
  used in the current position within the pipeline.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Add notion of current job, and then allow bg/fg ops to omit args.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Would multiprocessing.Process provide better streaming than
subprocess.Popen? I.e., not waiting for op to complete.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Should help output go through more?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Configuration:

- Look in ~, /etc/marcel.

- Be able to specify config file (or multiple locations) in startup.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

History commands

- If history were in the namespace, then edited_command wouldn't need
  special handling.

But keeping the whole history in memory is a waste of memory.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Not all ops can be used in API, e.g. edit, help. What about fork? remote?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

API needs documentation. help? HTML?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Exit codes? (Not just an api issue)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

window: what is supposed to happen if overlap = 0? disjoint = 0? Not tested.
test types other than int

----------------------------------------------------------------------

sudo has a zillion args. How to express this on sudo()? **kwargs?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

first constructs an Exception out of an Error.

Is it feasible to have Error carry the original exception, and reraise
it, or at least an exception of the same type? What if the Error was
remote?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

ls spacing is too wide. How to pick a width? Buffer results? Don't
buffer and adapt?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

This is broken: Op.op_name() evalutes to "op".

    @staticmethod
    def check_arg(ok, arg, message):
        if not ok:
            cause = (f'Incorrect usage of {Op.op_name()}: {message}'
                     if arg is None else
                     f'Incorrect value for {arg} argument of {Op.op_name()}: {message}')
            raise marcel.exception.KillCommandException(cause)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

ps lines are often long enough to wrap. Should render_full leave off
args? If so, then provide an args method.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

What if there are two shells running at the same time -- how is
history file maintained? Probably lose updates from the first one to
exit. How should this be handled? To be safe, on exit, should read,
append, write. Atomically.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Should jobs and commands be objects? That would allow for better
formatting.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Should {...} work as a glob pattern? It does in bash. pathlib.Path.glob
doesn't.

ls -fr ~/git/marcel/{marcel,test} \
| select (f: f.suffix == '.py') \
| map (f: f.readlines()) \
| expand \
| red count
No qualifying paths: ['~/git/marcel/{marcel,test}']

----------------------------------------------------------------------

cat = [ map (f: (f, f.readlines())) | expand 1 ]
(cat)

prints:

    pipeline(map(f: (f, f.readlines())) | expand(1))

It would be nice to have the original source.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

These commands do different things:

    ls -fr **/*.py
    ls -fr | select (f: f.suffix == '.py')

The first one avoids symlinks (or symlinks to visited directories? or
files?). The second one explores both paths.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

I keep forgetting to set pipeline's error handler. Could be done by
Pipeline.copy.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

env has paths as strings. Should be Paths.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

ls API: Need to complain if depth is other than 0 or 1

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Exhaustive type error testing in API?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

stack traces: Include them, but have print_stack check a flag to
determine if they should really be printed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

TestBase.reset_environment does too much. Move everything but Main
construction into subclasses.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Controlling Popen processes:

https://pymotw.com/2/subprocess/#process-groups-sessions

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Should a var hide an op by the same name?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Oops, [] is overloaded:

M-0.9.17 jao@cheese:/tmp/csv$ ls [b-f]*.csv
Operator ls: filenames must be a string: [runpipeline(b-f)]

But escaping works:

M-0.10.6 jao@cheese:~$ ls \[p-r\]*

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Can't run ssh!

----------------------------------------------------------------------

EDITOR set to host's EDITOR on startup. Which is convenient, but odd
if host value changes. How to keep the two in sync? Maybe reporting
EDITOR should always get the value of os.getenv('EDITOR')?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Nushell uses $it for current pipeline item. Not a bad
idea. Alternative to args (without --all).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Tab completion:

- We often know when an op ends. Can tab-complete for |, >, >>, [, ], Enter.

- We sometimes know when an arg is not a flag. Can prompt for var, (, [.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Help needs to discuss >, >>, pipeline params.

help pipeline, examples summing filesizes are inconsistent. Unclear
that early ones compute local sum of sizes, and later ones are global.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

In api functions, why [None] instead of []? E.g., in store()

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Operator and pipeline logging, easily controllable, is needed. Can
this be done avoiding runtime penalty when logging not in use?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

ls abc.{x,y}

is not parsed properly, because the comma is its own token.

Could fix this by recognizing COMMA only in the right context. (Lexer
would need to know Parser state.)

OR: in the context that a comma is used, look for string instead, and
check that it is a comma.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Arg checking (derived from bug 129):

Doing parse-time checking isn't sufficient. A check is also needed at
execution time, for args that need to be evaluated. The conversion
functions in ArgsParser (e.g. str_to_int) don't really allow for that
second use, as they are tied to the ArgsParser object, which isn't
available at runtime. They could *almost* be made independent of
ArgsParser, but there are some dependencies:

- self.op_name: op isn't available during arg parsing. 

- self.env

- self.current_op: For function(). Need to revisit error handling
  (which is why f.set_op(self.current_op) is called), and perhaps get
  rid of this call.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Tab completion for env vars.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Can threading/multiprocessing (for fork) be replaced by async io?

https://realpython.com/async-io-python/

And maybe for the bash op:

- create_subprocess_exec
- create_subprocess_shell

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Documentation for builtin functions

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Osh handled stdin:

    osh ^ ...

Need something like this for marcel.

The read op (without a FILENAME) assumes that inputs are File objects,
not a stream of text.

What about connecting stdin to input stream? If nothing shows up, no
harm. As long as we don't get stuck waiting forever.

----------------------------------------------------------------------


- Get rid of Environment.cluster(self, name). Fork should call getvar
  instead, and then ensure that the returned value is iterable. (Use
  iter() to get the iterator, or raise TypeError).


----------------------------------------------------------------------

Should allow pipeline vars for args:

    ... | args pipeline_var

Add -r|--remote flag to fork. Currently there, sort of, hidden, for
use by @ syntax. (See Fork.execute_remotely()).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Get rid of Pipeline.set_error_handler. Can the error handler be
inherited from Pipeline.copy()?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

IDEA: Implement interactive usage by translating into API.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Resurrect SQL

----------------------------------------------------------------------

test_ls(): See test_filename_ops. Interactive only, need API vesrion.

ls needs work on links. From bash:

-H, --dereference-command-line

    follow symbolic links listed on the command line

--dereference-command-line-symlink-to-dir

    follow each command line symbolic link that points to a directory

-L, --dereference

    when showing file information for a symbolic link, show
    information for the file the link references rather than for the
    link itself

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Args unwraps input, and tp definition has to deal with it:

tp = (| head 1 | \
        args (| x: \
            ((x,) if type(x) is not tuple else x) | \
            (*x: tuple([type(y) for y in x])) \
        |) \
     |)

Should the unwrapping by args be unconditional?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Extend COLOR_SCHEME, adding a color for commands (i.e., user input).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

CSV handling: add options for specifying quote and delimiter. Can then
drop the distinction between CSV and TSV.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Tab completion for executables.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Why does marcel lose colorization?

Running grep from bash colorizes (run the command to see):

Have expand work on maps?

E.g. expand {'a': 1, 'b': 2} -> ('a', 1), ('b', 2)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Reduction to form a list is clunky. Need to enclose the items to be
gathered into lists before reduction with +.

    p = (| n: gen (int(n)) | (x: (x, [x]*x)) | expand 1

    p 5 | (x, y: (x, [y]) | red . +

Also, list growth is quadratic. Each reduction with + requires copying
of the list.

Could add a reduction function, gather:

    p 5 | red . gather

gather(x) -> x for non-list x.

def gather(acc, x):
    if acc is None:
        return [x]
    else:
        acc.append(x)
        return acc

This appends to an accumulating list instead of creating a new list
each time, so linear.


In reduction.py, r_concat does exactly this, so that red . concat works.

But the reduction function must be hardwired. Why not open it up?

Fast file and string operations: for "long" strings, large files (multi GB)

https://github.com/ashvardanian/Stringzilla

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Tab completion:

After op, provide both flags and filenames.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

env no longer sent to farcel via pipeline. But what about function globals?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Sql uses %s formatting to set vars from upstream data, e.g.

    sql 'insert into proc values(%s, %s, %s)'

Using a function:

    sql (x, y, z: 'insert into proc values((x), (y), (z))')

Or

    sql (x, y, z: f'insert into proc values({x}, {y}, {z})')

----------------------------------------------------------------------

head n (n > 0) should terminate after n. Otherwise, might need to
wait for a very long time.

But how to terminate? Throwing an exception back up to Command.execute is wrong, e.g.

    ... | ifthen (*x: ...) (| head 3 | ... |) ...

head can't terminate the entire command, but should be able to
terminate the pipeline it belongs to.

Idea:

- Throw TruncateInputStreamException

- Caught by Command.execute (or maybe Pipeline.run) and suppressed.

- Subclass receive or run can catch it and do something else. E.g. ifthen is currently:

    def receive(self, env, x):
        if self.call(env, self.predicate, *x):
            self.then.receive(env, x)
        self.send(env, x)

  Modification:

    def setup(self, env):
        ...
        self.then_active = True
        self.downstream_active = True

    def receive(self, env, x):
        if self.then_active and self.call(env, self.predicate, *x):
            try:
                self.then.receive(env, x)
            except TruncateInputStreamException:
                self.then_active = False
        if self.downstream_active:
            try:
                self.send(env, x)
            else:
                self.downstream_active = False


Hmm. This will get very complicated. Would need to identify and fix
ops having this problem, and then test head downstream of every op.

What does bash do?
