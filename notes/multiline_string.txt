I just added parse_args, which takes a usage argument. But multiline
strings (i.e., triple-quoted) don't work in scripts, so currently
usage is limited to a single line, which is useless.

This works interactively:

   ('''abc
   def''')

producting this output:

   abc
   def

But from a script:

    '''abc: Not a python string
    def''') is not executable.

And if an escape is added to the end of the first line:

    abcdef

This needs to be fixed in PythonString. Triple-quotes are already
detected. Could modify the isspace() handler, but the problem is that
self.next_char() is terminated by the end of the current line, as
detected by input(). I.e., input() doesn't realize that the terminal
\n should be part of a triple-quoted string.
