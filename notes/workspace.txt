Keep track of multiple histories


What happens when there are concurrent workspaces. Does one exiting
overwrite history from another?

Merge them all into one history?

If multiple histories are tracked, how to select one on startup?

Bash:

- history read at startup

- Changes tracked and written on exit. (Or maybe the whole history
  including changes from this console). But there isn't an
  overwrite. So on exit, the history must be read again, and local
  changes appended?

Generalizing this: Keep track of workspaces:

- A workspace has its own history.

- Vars are scoped to the workspace, and restarting a workspace brings back
  those vars and their values.

- Disallow multiple concurrent uses of a workspace?

- Support workspace upload and download.

- I guess workspaces need names, or some way to refer to
  them. E.g. start marcel with workspace foobar. If no workspace
  specified, then:

  - vars not preserved?
  - what happens to history on exit?

- Stream-valued vars can be large (on disk). Provide a way to manage
  them.

From https://github.com/geophile/marcel/issues/6:

    - Ability to hibernate (save context, close, and open it back again)

Exactly, that's a workspace.
    
    - Ability to store multiple result buffers (aka output of previous commands).

    - Ability to access the stored buffers and run processing functions on
      them (e.g. I take a snapshot of counters and after a while another
      snapshot - can I see the diff?)

Idea: Store results of previous commands automatically, (results would
be BEFORE an implicit write). Be able to recall these, based on this
history mechanism.


----------------------------------------------------------------------

Wait a minute. Why is automatically storing every command output a
good idea? It's already easy enough to store wanted results in a
variable, and then, with workspaces, persist those variables.

With everything stored, there's a lot to wade through, and cleaning
up, being selective about what's kept is labor intensive. Too easy to
accidentally delete something, too easy to be cautious and keep
everything, and then it's difficult to find what you want. Also
EVERYTHING is kept. Common shell usage is to refine commands until
they work properly. Just save the final, correct version.

Infinite output problem iss avoided. It should be pretty obvious that
"timer 1 ... > var" is a bad idea.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
    

Possible rules on workspace usage:

- A workspace can be used by at most one marcel instance at a time.

- Starting an anonymous workspace (no workspace selected) creates a new
  one. Resuming a workspace blocks anyone else from resuming the same
  workspace, (attempt results in error message and exit).

- Exiting anonymous workspace:

  - Present option to name it (don't allow duplicate names).

  - If declined, then save anyway with some identifying information?
    Or just delete it? Could save it with some descriptive information
    (e.g. start/end timestamps) to allow it to be located later.

- Exiting named workspace: No user input required.

- Allow for workspace rename



How is a named workspace deleted? Need workspace commands. Can only delete
one workspace while it is not in use, and from some other workspace.



Workspace management:

- List workspaces: name, size

- Delete workspace

- Duplicate workspace, giving duplicate a new name

- Start marcel with a named workspace. Problem: If you can't remember
  the name, you would need to start marcel to find out the name.

- Switch workspaces? That solves the forgotten name problem: Start anon,
  select a workspace. Switching to it ends the anon workspace. But then do
  we need all the end-of-anon workspace stuff?

- Prune workspace, deleting some subset of saved results. By time? By
  size? User-selected? Or have the user identify what to keep?

- Workspace state:

  - In /var/lib/marcel, owned by root? Maybe, but it's per-user
    state. Could also go to .local/share/marcel. But it's potentially
    a lot of space. Allow for user control.

  - Need to enforce a max, in case of commands that never end, e.g. "timer 1 | ..."


----------------------------------------------------------------------

On disk:

Each workspace has its own startup?

.local/share/marcel/
    startup.py  # For anon workspaces, and template for named workspaces
    WORKSPACE_NAME/
        startup.py
        workspace.p  # Workspace properties (pickled)
        env.p: Pickled environment
        history

Should workspace.p omit workspace name? If it's included, then that
creates an opportunity for a discrepancy, in case of a manual rename
of the WORKSPACE_NAME directory. And a workspace rename command gets more
complicated.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

workspace 

- use NAME

  - use workspace with given NAME.

  - close existing workspace

- close

  - close current workspace

  - If anonymous: save with a new name? discard?

- list

  - list all workspaces
    - name
    - create timestamp
    - last saved timestamp
    - size on disk

- properties:

  - name
  - startup file
  - create timestamp
  - last save timestamp
  - max size on disk
  - max size on disk for a single command output

----------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the role of a startup script? Does it get run once at the
beginning of the workspace? Or on each instantiation?

The imports are needed each time a process starts. The only (?) other
thing the startup script does is to populate the environment. The
imports can be viewed as adding to the namespace some values that
should not or cannot be persisted, e.g. modules.

Harmless to run obsolete definitions from startup.py, as long as that
precedes loading the environment. The environment will have the most
current version, and probably overwrite much of what is done in
startup without resulting in any change. E.g. the COLOR_SCHEMA
probably doesn't change.

Alternatively: The workspace DOES NOT have a startup script, just an
environment. But getting imported modules and functions right looks
difficult and delicate.

Could do the imports in RUN_ON_STARTUP. The import op could then
record what's been imported, and duplicate that in each
instance. Maybe block reassignment of imported symbols.

But having a startup script is convenient. I *can* replace a prompt
interactively, but it's kind of a pain. It would be nice to have a
startup script that does that. But then, you want the startup script
overriding the environment! E.g. if I want a new prompt: the env
already has one. I edit the startup script to get a new one. If env
overwrites startup script, then I don't get the new prompt.

So how about this:

- Startup loads environment

- Then runs startup script

This gets imports and a new prompt. But it also could "revert" and env
change. 

How about this: a symbol that comes in from the startup script cannot
be changed interactively, (i.e., assigned), it has to be done by
editing the startup script. (Changes already take effect immediately.)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Workspace creation

I originally thought that you would use an anonymous marcel workspace,
decide to create a workspace, and that the instance's history (just the
commands in that instance) and environment would then be saved to
initialize the workspace. But that is messy. Those commands, and that
environment are part of the anonymous workspace, and could be persisted
at any time.

Creating a workspace on first reference to a new workspace name seems
dangerous. E.g. "switch to workspace abc" could succeed, creating a
workspace because that name is not in use. But what if it was a typo,
and the user meant abd. In that case, we have stuff in abc that should
have been in abd, and there doesn't seem to be a good way to rerun
those commands against abd. The results might have been completely
different.

So workspace creation should be explicit, on startup or during an
instance.


----------------------------------------------------------------------

Workspace is the wrong word! I think common usage restricts it to a
continuous block of time.

======================================================================

Workspaces spec

Concepts:

A marcel *session* is marcel running in a process. Typically, once the marcel
session *exits*, the process terminates, and that session no longer
exists.

A *workspace* is the context in which marcel commands executes.  An
session is always associated with exactly one workspace. At
all times, a workspace may be used by at most one session.

A workspace comprises the following:

- A command history: As marcel executes commands, they are recorded in
  the workspace's command history.

- A startup script: This provides some imports and definitions to be
  used by the session.

- An environment: This is a set of environment variables, established
  in part by the startup script.

As marcel runs commands, the commands are recorded in the command
history. The commands reference and may modify environment
variables. All changes to the command history and environment persist
from one session using a workspace, to the next one. The
startup script can only be modified by editing it. If the current
workspace's startup script is modified, then the effects take place
starting with the next command issued in that workspace (even in the
same session).

*** BUT IF THIS IS TRUE, THEN THERE CAN'T BE CONCURRENT MARCEL
    SESSIONS USING THE DEFAULT WORKSPACE. ***


*** Interactive vs API: Command history is API only. Environment in
    the API is fuzzy -- do env vars make sense, or are there just
    python vars? Startup script exists. test_api relies on cluster
    definitions, for example. Probably shouldn't do that, rely on
    normal python code to set up the cluster. ***


A workspace has:

- A name

- A startup script

- A command history

- An environment (set of name/value bindings).


*** ANONYMOUS WORKSPACE? DEFAULT WORKSPACE? ***


Workspace operations:

Workspace creation:

A workspace must be created before it can be used. Workspace creation
should be possible when marcel starts (e.g. using a --create-workspace
flag), or while marcel is running, through a command.

*** DOES CREATING A WORKSPACE SWITCH TO IT?

When a workspace is created, it gets a new environment (determined by
the parent process's environment and the startup script), and a new
command history. The workspace gets its own startup script which is
initially a copy of the default startup script. 


Workspace deletion:

A workspace is deleted by command. Deletion is permitted only when there
are no sessions bound to it.


Workspace duplication:

There needs to be a workspace command for duplicating a workspace, giving
the copy its own name. Duplication is permitted only when there are no
sessions bound to it.


Workspace rename:

There needs to be a workspace command for renaming a workspace, Renaming
is permitted only when there are no sessions bound to it.


Workspace selection:

If marcel is started with a workspace name, then the session is
associated with the named workspace. Otherwise, the session is
associcated with the default workspace.

An session can switch to a different workspace. If an session switches
from workspace A to workspace B, any changes to workspace A are written to
disk. (They may or may not have been partially written to disk before
the switch.) In switching, workspace B's startup script is run, and the
command history and environment are switched to those that were saved
the last time that an session running workspace B exited. *** DEFINE
EXITED ***


Workspace listing:

Listing workspaces can be done in two ways:

1) marcel --list-workspaces

2) Through a workspace command.


----------------------------------------------------------------------

Workspaces implementation

There must be a standard way to lock things in Linux. Alternative:
When using a workspace, create a .IN_USE file. Other processes check it.
Problem: there are ways for the process to end suddently, leaving the
.IN_USE file in place erroneously.

The .IN_USE file could store a pid. If that process is not running,
then it is a sign that the workspace is not actually in use and can be
deleted.
