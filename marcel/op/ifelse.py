{L,wrap=F}ifelse PREDICATE [THEN_PIPELINE]

{L,indent=4:28}{r:PREDICATE}               Used to determine if an input tuple is passed
to the {r:THEN_PIPELINE}

{L,indent=4:28}{r:THEN_PIPELINE}           This pipeline receives tuples for which 
{r:PREDICATE} evaluates to True.

{r:PREDICATE} is applied to each input tuple. If the {r:PREDICATE} evaluates to
True, then the tuple is passed to the {r:THEN_PIPELINE}. Otherwise, 
the tuple is passed downstream.

{b:Example}

{L,indent=4,wrap=F}gen 100 | ifthen (x: x % 2 == 0) [store even] | store odd

{r:gen 100} generates a stream of integers, 0, ..., 99.
The predicate is True for even integers. These integers are
passed to the {r:[store even]} pipeline, which stores the numbers in the variable {r:even}.
Odd integers only are passed downstream, to {r:store odd} which stores numbers in the {r:odd}
variable.
