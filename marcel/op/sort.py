HELP = '''
{L,wrap=F}sort [KEY]

{L,indent=4:28}{r:KEY}                     The function to be applied to input tuples, to get the values by which tuples 
should be ranked.

The input stream is sorted and written to the output stream.

If a {r:KEY} is not specified, then input tuples are ordered according to Python rules.
Otherwise, ordering is based on the values computed by applying {r:KEY} to each input tuple.
