HELP = '''
{L,wrap=F}difference PIPELINE

{L,indent=4:28}{r:PIPELINE}                The second input to the difference.

The output stream represents the difference of the tuples in the input stream (to be referred
to as the {i:left} input), and the tuples
from the {r:PIPELINE} argument (to be referred to as the {i:right} input). 
A tuple is included in the output if it is present in the left input,
and not present
in the right input.
The tuples must be hashable, which requires that every element
of each tuple must be hashable.

Input elements from the two input pipelines are considered to be the same if they are equal (in
the Python sense).

Because the input pipelines may contain duplicates, the {r:difference} operator actually computes
a difference of bags. If a given tuple appears {n:n} times in the left input, and {n:m} times in
the right, then the output stream will contain {n:max(n-m, 0)} occurrences. The order of tuples in the
output is unspecified.
