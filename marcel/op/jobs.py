HELP = '''
{L,wrap=F}jobs

Write the currently running jobs to the output stream. This includes jobs that are currently paused.

The jobs listed may be running, denoted as {n:(+)}; or paused, denoted as {n:(-)}.
While it is extremely unlikely, a job that is no longer running may be displayed
also, denoted as {n:(x)}. 
    
Every job includes a job number and a process id. Note that job numbers may change over time,
as a job number simply reflects the job's position in the list of jobs. Process ids never change.
The job number can be used in conjunction with the {r:bg} and {r:fg} commands.
