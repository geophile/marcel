HELP = '''
{L,wrap=F}edit [COMMAND]

{L,indent=4:28}{r:COMMAND}                 The number of the command to be edited.

Open an editor to edit the command identified by {r:COMMAND} in the command history,
(obtained by running the {n:history} operator). I {r:COMMAND} is omitted, the most recently
executed command will be edited. The editor is selected by the {n:EDITOR}
environment variable. On exiting the editor, the edited command
will be on the command line. (Hit enter to run the command, as usual.)
