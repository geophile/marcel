HELP = '''
{L,wrap=F}union PIPELINE ...

{L,indent=4:28}{r:PIPELINE}                The second input to the union.

The output stream represents the union of the tuples in the input stream, and the tuples
from the {r:PIPELINE} arguments.

Duplicates are maintained. If a given tuple appears {n:n} times in one input, and {n:m} times in
the other, then the output stream will contain {n:m+n} occurrences. The order of tuples in the
output is unspecified.
