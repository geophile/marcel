{L,wrap=F}join [-k|--keep] PIPELINE

{L,indent=4:28}{r:-k}, {r:--keep}              Write an output tuple from the left input even if there is no matching
tuple from the right input.

{L,indent=4:28}{r:PIPELINE}                The second (right) input to the join.

Computes a database-style join between the input stream, 
and a second stream from the given {r:PIPELINE}.

The input pipeline provides one input to the join, named {i:left}.
The {r:PIPELINE} argument provides the second input, named {i:right}.
Left and right tuples are matched by comparing their first elements. For matching
pairs, an output tuple consists of the left tuple followed by the right tuple with the
first value removed. (That would be redundant since the tuples were matched on their
first values.)

The {r:--keep} flag causes left inputs to be passed to output as is, when there is no
matching right input. (In database terms, this is a left join.)

{b:Example}

The left input has 6 tuples of the form {n:(x, -x)}, generated by {n:gen 6 | map (x: (x, -x))}.
The right input has 4 tuples of the form {n:(x, x**2)}, generated by {n:gen 4 | map (x: (x, x**2))}.
The join is computed as follows:

{L,wrap=F}gen 6 | map (x: (x, -x)) | join [ gen 4 | map (x: (x, x**2)) ]

This generates the following output:

{P,wrap=F,indent=4}
(0, 0, 0)
(1, -1, 1)
(2, -2, 4)
(3, -3, 9)

If the {r:--keep} flag were included, the output would have two additional rows:

{P,wrap=F,indent=4}
(0, 0, 0)
(1, -1, 1)
(2, -2, 4)
(3, -3, 9)
(4, -4)
(5, -5)
