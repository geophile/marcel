HELP = '''
Several marcel operators rely on {i:functions}. For example, you can
list {n:.mp3} files anywhere inside your home directory as follows:

{L,wrap=F}ls -fr ~ | select (lambda f: f.suffix.lower() == '.mp3')

{r:ls -fr ~} lists files only ({r:-f}), recursively ({r:-r}), starting with
the home directory ({r:~}). The {r:ls} operator yields {n:File} objects
which are then piped to the {r:select} operator.

{r:select} has a function, delimited by parentheses. This function binds
each {n:File} arriving on the input stream, to the parameter {r:f}. The
function returns True if the {n:File}'s suffix is {n:.mp3}, False
otherwise. {n:File} objects support the {n:pathlib.Path} interface, so
{r:f.suffix} returns the extension of {n:File} {r:f}, (including the
dot). Then, {r:.lower()} converts the extension to lower case, and the
resulting string is compared to {r:.mp3}.

All marcel operators that rely on functions use the same syntax demonstrated 
here: The function is enclosed in parentheses; the parameters are bound
to components of incoming tuples. And in all cases, the {n:lambda} keyword
can be omitted. So the preceding example could be rewritten as:

{L,wrap=F}ls -fr ~ | select (f: f.suffix.lower() == '.mp3')

Marcel functions run in a namespace maintained by marcel. Run
{n:help namespace} for more information on this topic.

{b:Evaluating functions to compute command arguments}

Functions can also be used to compute the value of command arguments. For example,
to condense an input stream into groups of size 10, you can use the {n:window}
operator:

{L,wrap=F}... | window --disjoint 10 | ...

If your group size is stored in the {r:GROUP_SIZE} variable, you could obtain
the value of the variable by using a function:

{L,wrap=F}... | window --disjoint (GROUP_SIZE) | ...

Recall that marcel allows omission of the {n:lambda} keyword, so {r:(GROUP_SIZE)}
is equivalent to {r:(lambda: GROUP_SIZE)}, i.e., a function of zero arguments
that returns the value of the {r:GROUP_SIZE} variable. That variable
is present in the marcel namespace, and so is available to the function
being executed.

{b:Marcel as a calculator}

You can also evaluate a function as the first command in a pipelines. This
allows you to use marcel as a calculator, e.g. 

{L}(hex(123))

This is shorthand for:

{L}map (lambda: hex(123))

which runs the builtin Python function {r:hex} with the input {r:123}, and prints
the result, {r:0x7b}.
