HELP = '''
Your configuration script, typically {n:~/.config/marcel/startup.py} should do the following to
make a few useful functions available to your commands:

{L}from marcel.builtin import *

While the {n:from ... import *} idiom is discouraged, it seems like the
right tool to use here. Otherwise, you need to use qualified function names,
e.g. {n:marcel.builtin.now()}; or explicitly create a new variable in the namespace
(e.g. {n:now = marcel.builtin.now}). 

The functions in {n:marcel.builtin} are:

{L,indent=4:6}- {n:processes}: A list containing a {n:Process} object for each
current process.

{L,indent=4:6}- {n:now}: The current time as a float, as seconds since the epoch.

{L,indent=4:6}- {n:minutes}: Converts minutes to seconds, for comparison with epoch
time calculations. E.g. minutes(1) returns 60.

{L,indent=4:6}- {n:hours}: Converts hours to seconds.

{L,indent=4:6}- {n:days}: Converts days to seconds.
