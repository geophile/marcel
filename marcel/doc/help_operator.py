Marcel {i:operators} take streams of Python values as input and generate streams of
Python values as output. Operators are thus combined via pipes, as in more conventional shells (which are limited
to passing textual data).

{b:Command-line arguments:}

In general, an operator has a number of command-line arguments,
comprising flags, flags followed by values, and anonymous values (i.e., not preceded by a flag). Flags
have long and short forms.

For example, the {n:gen} command has three arguments:

{L,wrap=F}gen [-p|--pad PAD] [COUNT [START]]

{L,indent=4:28}{r:-p,} {r:--pad}               Specifies the width of the padded output.

{L,indent=4:28}{r:COUNT}                   The number of integers to be written to output. 

{L,indent=4:28}{r:START}                   The first integer to be written to output. 

{b:Input and output streams:}

An operator may receive input from a preceding command through a pipe, and
send output to a succeeding operator through a pipe. The {n:gen} command
does not require an input stream, but it does generate output. For example,
{n:gen 5} generates the stream 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.

Streams always carry tuples between commands. Often, these are
1-tuples.  For example, the {n:ls} operator generates a stream
containing {n:File} objects, each wrapped in a 1-tuple. When a host OS
executable is run, its {n:stdout} is conveyed to the next command by
wrapping strings (separated by \\\\n characters) in 1-tuples. Marcel
operators can generate n-tuples, with n > 1. For example, this command
sequence lists files (only, no directories or symlinks) in the current
directory, and uses the {r:map} operator to generate a stream of
filename and file size values:

{p,wrap=F,indent=4}ls -f | map (f: (f.name, f.size))

{b:Obtaining output}

The only marcel operator that writes output is {n:write}. Every command sequence
has an {n:write} at the end, implicitly if necessary. By default, {n:ouwritet} simply uses
the Python {n:str} method to generate its output. For example, the above command 
sequence generates output that looks like this (for {n:/etc/sysctl.d}):

{p,wrap=F,indent=4}
('10-console-messages.conf', 77)
('10-ipv6-privacy.conf', 490)
('10-kernel-hardening.conf', 726)
('10-link-restrictions.conf', 257)
('10-magic-sysrq.conf', 1184)
('10-network-security.conf', 158)
('10-pop-default-settings.conf', 19)
('10-ptrace.conf', 1292)
('10-zeropage.conf', 506)
('30-postgresql-shm.conf', 462)
('README.sysctl', 792)
('protect-links.conf', 324)

The {n:write} command can be made explicit to add formatting and redirection options.
For example, to format the above output differently:

{p,wrap=F,indent=4}
ls -f | map (f: (f.name, f.size)) | out '\\{\\}: \\{\\}'

The standard Python formatting string, '\\{\\}: \\{\\}' produces this output:

{p,wrap=F,indent=4}
10-console-messages.conf: 77
10-ipv6-privacy.conf: 490
10-kernel-hardening.conf: 726
10-link-restrictions.conf: 257
10-magic-sysrq.conf: 1184
10-network-security.conf: 158
10-pop-default-settings.conf: 19
10-ptrace.conf: 1292
10-zeropage.conf: 506
30-postgresql-shm.conf: 462
README.sysctl: 792
protect-links.conf: 324

Run {n:help out} for more information on the {n:out} command.

{b:Error handling}

In a major departure from other shells, marcel does not support the
concept of {n:stdout} and {n:stderr}. Instead, errors are written to the
operator's output stream as an object of type
{n:marcel.object.Error}. {n:Error}s are not passed through operators. Instead
they are forwarded from one stream to the next, until a {n:write} operator is encountered.
At that point, the {n:Error} is printed and then not passed further downstream.

For example, suppose directory {n:/tmp/d} contains three directories:

{p,wrap=F,indent=4}
M jao@cheese:/tmp/d$ ls
rwxr-xr-x jao      jao              4096 /tmp/d/hi
r-------- root     root             4096 /tmp/d/nope
rwxr-xr-x jao      jao              4096 /tmp/d/welcome

The {r:nope} directory cannot be visited, due to permissions. If we try
to list all files and directories recursively:

{p,wrap=F,indent=4}
M jao@cheese:/tmp/d$ ls -r
drwxr-xr-x jao      jao              4096 /tmp/d/hi
-rw-r--r-- jao      jao                 0 /tmp/d/hi/a.txt
-rw-r--r-- jao      jao                 0 /tmp/d/hi/b.txt
dr-------- root     root             4096 /tmp/d/nope
{c550:Error(Cannot explore /tmp/d/nope: permission denied)}
drwxr-xr-x jao      jao              4096 /tmp/d/welcome
-rw-r--r-- jao      jao                 0 /tmp/d/welcome/c.txt
-rw-r--r-- jao      jao                 0 /tmp/d/welcome/d.txt

Notice that the {r:nope} directory is listed as before, but we get an
error on the attempt to go inside of it. The position of
the {r:Error} in the output indicates when the
attempt was made -- between listing the {r:hi} and {r:welcome} directories.

For host OS executables, each line of {n:stderr} is turned into an {n:Error}
and written to the same stream receiving {n:stdout}.
